### Install Automatically from CKAN
Not available for beta release.

### Install Manually
1. **Install Kcalbeloh System**

   * If you are updating this mod, make sure you delete the previous version completely before installing the new version.  
2. **Install Dependencies**
   * [**Kopernicus**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200143-181-1122-kopernicus-stable-branch-last-updated-november-25th-2021/): for creating custom celestial bodies.
