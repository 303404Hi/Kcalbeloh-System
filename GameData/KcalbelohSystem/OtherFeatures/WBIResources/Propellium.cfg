// This config removes Propellium from the gas/ice giants and wormholes for type 0/1.  Default configurations remain.
//
//Resource types:  
//	0 = Crustal			(Stuff you dig up)
//	1 = Oceanic			(Stuff in the oceans)
//	2 = Atmospheric		(Stuff in the air, varies with pressure)
//	3 = Interplanetary	(Stuff you find between planets)
//
	//description = This kit stores Propellium, the lightest weight and highest efficiency propellant known to chemical rocketry. It is cryogenic liquid hydrons and is required for the creation of LiquidFuel, Water and so on.
