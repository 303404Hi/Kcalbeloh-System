// This config removes Rock from the gas/ice giants and wormholes for type 0/1.  Default configurations remain.
//
//Resource types:  
//	0 = Crustal			(Stuff you dig up)
//	1 = Oceanic			(Stuff in the oceans)
//	2 = Atmospheric		(Stuff in the air, varies with pressure)
//	3 = Interplanetary	(Stuff you find between planets)
//
	//description = This kit stores Rock, the majority component of the surfaces of many planets and moons. It's far from rich in usable materials as Ore is, but tends to be abundant in dust form around many planets, especially ringed ones, and can be scooped and sifted by orbiting craft.
