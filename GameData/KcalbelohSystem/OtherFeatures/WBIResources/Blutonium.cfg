// This config removes Blutonium from the gas/ice giants and wormholes for type 0.  Default configurations remain.
//
//Resource types:  
//	0 = Crustal			(Stuff you dig up)
//	1 = Oceanic			(Stuff in the oceans)
//	2 = Atmospheric		(Stuff in the air, varies with pressure)
//	3 = Interplanetary	(Stuff you find between planets)
//
	//description = This kit stores Blutonium, an Ore of radioactive materials, from which NuclearFuel and other pure nuclear substances are refined.
