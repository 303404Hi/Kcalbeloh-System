// This config removes Minerite from the gas/ice giants and wormholes for type 0/1.  Default configurations remain.
//
//Resource types:  
//	0 = Crustal			(Stuff you dig up)
//	1 = Oceanic			(Stuff in the oceans)
//	2 = Atmospheric		(Stuff in the air, varies with pressure)
//	3 = Interplanetary	(Stuff you find between planets)
//
	//description = This kit stores Minerite, an Ore of many semi-rare or otherwise vital minerals such as salts, most of which are not found in typical Ore. It is important to LFO production and vital to processes of filtration, distillation and enrichment.
