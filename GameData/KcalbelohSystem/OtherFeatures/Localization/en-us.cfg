        // ******************************** Planet descriptions ********************************
        #LOC_KS_Aciore_description = Anehta is a gas giant planet that boasts a stunning planetary ring system. The planet is characterized by its perpetual cloud cover, which is divided into distinct lighter-hued zones and darker belts. Due to the conflicting circulation patterns of these zones and belts, the planet experiences violent storms and turbulence.
        #LOC_KS_Ahtpan_description = Ahtpan is a rocky desert planet with oceans primarily composed of naphtha. While it may seem like a good idea to construct a petrochemical plant on the planet's surface, the Kerbal Space Center (KSC) advises all kerbonauts to keep their helmets on while exploring the planet. This is because the planet's atmosphere emits a strong odor of mothballs!
        #LOC_KS_Anneheg_description = Anneheg is a planet with a dark, coal-like appearance that closely orbits around Aralc-A. Due to its proximity to the star, the intense heat and light have caused much of its surface to melt, resulting in the formation of lava rivers and oceans, as well as frequent vaporized metal storms. With its inhospitable conditions, Anneheg is regarded as one of the most hellish planets ever discovered.
        #LOC_KS_AralcA_description = Aralc-A is the first star of the binary system in Kcalbeloh system and is considered to be the brightest and most massive star in the system. Its high temperature and blue-white color suggest that it is an A-type main-sequence star.
        #LOC_KS_AralcB_description = Aralc-B, the second star in the binary system, is a small, low-mass star classified as an M-type main sequence star, also known as a red dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_AralcSystem_description = This is the barycenter of the binary star system.
        #LOC_KS_Arorua_description = Arorua is a large rocky planet tidally locked by Aralc-B. As a result of the strong solar winds emanating from Aralc-B, aurora can be observed from the entire hemisphere facing Aralc-B. At the same time, its atmosphere is gradually blowing away by the solar wind from the red dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_Dipuc_description = Dipuc is the only moon of Sera and its surface is marked by large craters, indicating that it has absorbed many severe meteorite impacts that would have otherwise struck Sera. The moon is also geologically active, featuring a significant number of active volcanoes on its surface as well as massive mountains that are visible even when near Sera.
        #LOC_KS_Efil_description = Efil appears like a sapphire nestled close to Anehta when viewed from a distance. Its charming atmosphere and beautiful beaches make it seem like an ideal vacation spot. Perhaps in the future, the Kerbal Space Center (KSC) will build a resort there. However, the question remains as to who could afford the ticket to visit this distant planet.
        #LOC_KS_Elad_description = Elad is the largest moon of Anehta and was the first of Anehta's moons to be discovered. It is believed that Elad had an atmosphere in the past and even supported liquid water on its surface, but it remains a mystery as to why the moon lost these characteristics over time.
        #LOC_KS_Enots_description = Enots is a small asteroid moon that is embedded within Anehta's ring system, and it is considered to be the smallest known moon of Anehta.
        #LOC_KS_Eulb_description = Eulb is … a blue moon.
        #LOC_KS_Iomena_description = Iomena is a rocky planet featuring large craters and oceans. Scientific research has indicated that the likelihood of life existing on this planet is exceedingly slim due to the high concentrations of ammonia present in both the atmosphere and oceans. Nonetheless, scientists have not abandoned the possibility of discovering life in such extreme environments.
        #LOC_KS_Kcalbeloh_description = Kcalbeloh is a supermassive black hole, and is the center of Kcalbeloh system. It doesn't have a jet or a superheated blue accretion disk, indicating it has probably not devoured a star in millions of years.
        #LOC_KS_Maelg_description = Maelg is the least massive and coolest star within the Kcalbeloh system, and consequently, it emits significantly less light than other stars. It is classified as an L-type brown dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_Mehtna_description = Mehtna is a frigid planet that is tidally locked to Maelg. The majority of its surface is covered by thick ice caps, except for the region near the sub-stellar point, which has been dubbed the "Warm Pole." Because of the planet's low atmospheric pressure, water boils well below room temperature, resulting in water existing primarily in the form of ice or water vapor.
        #LOC_KS_Meiuqer_description = Meiuqer is a small planet with an exceptionally eccentric orbit. Its surface temperature experiences significant fluctuations depending on its distance from Maelg.
        #LOC_KS_Noi_description = Noi is a Trojan asteroid that librates around the L4 Lagrange Point between Sunorc and the Simeht-Simetra System, which exists 60° ahead of the binary planets' barycenter in their orbit.
        #LOC_KS_Noira_description = Noria is the moon orbiting closest to the barycenter of the Simetra-Simeht binary planet system, and it is unique in the Kcalbeloh system for having a retrograde orbit. Its surface features a giant crater, suggesting it has experienced a significant impact from a relatively large celestial body in the past.
        #LOC_KS_Norihc_description = Norihc is a frigid moon that orbits the barycenter of the binary gas giants. Despite its icy exterior, it is geologically active and displays numerous deep fissures on its thick ice caps.
        #LOC_KS_Noyreg_description = Noyreg is a rocky moon with an extremely dense atmosphere, which obscures its surface beneath thick cloud layers. Its atmosphere has a mesmerizing green hue, but landing on this moon is considered extremely perilous due to the high concentrations of corrosive and toxic components in the air.
        #LOC_KS_Onrefni_description = Onrefni, a dwarf planet, orbits in extremely close proximity to Kcalbeloh, experiencing strong tidal forces that have torn its surface apart.
        #LOC_KS_Rouqea_description = Rouqea is a fascinating ocean world, completely covered in water. Unlike Laythe, its ocean is unique and distinct, with immense depths that could produce a mantle made of exotic ice due to the extreme pressure. Its mysterious and alluring depths continue to captivate the attention of researchers and scientists.
        #LOC_KS_Sedah_description = Sedah is a hot gas giant that orbits very closely to Sunorc. Its high atmospheric temperatures give it a slight glow. Despite being similar in size to Jool, it is only about one-seventh the mass of Jool, resulting in a less dense and more "fluffy" atmosphere.
        #LOC_KS_Sera_description = Sera is a barren, rocky planet with a striking ring system and several large lakes. Unfortunately, the lakes are toxic, and there is no known evidence of life on Sera.
        #LOC_KS_Simeht_description = Simeht, the smaller planet in the binary gas giant system, is also classified as an ice giant. However, unlike Simetra, its cloud bands and storms are difficult to observe in visible light.
        #LOC_KS_SimeSystem_description = This is the barycenter of the binary gas-giant system.
        #LOC_KS_Simetra_description = Simetra is the larger ice giant in the Simetra-Simeht binary gas giant system. Its blue appearance is attributed to the traces of methane found in its outermost regions, while other regions of the planet are believed to be colored green and yellow due to unknown compounds.
        #LOC_KS_Suluco_description = Suluco is a Kerbin-like planet that is tidally locked to Sunorc, meaning that one side of the planet always faces the star while the other side is in perpetual darkness. It is a bifurcated world, with a stark contrast between the two hemispheres. One side experiences an endless day while the other is shrouded in eternal night. The boundary between the two halves is a narrow ring of twilit eternity, which is the only region on the planet that could potentially support life.
        #LOC_KS_Sunorc_description = Sunorc is a K-type main sequence star, also known as an orange dwarf. It is smaller and cooler than Kerbol, making it of particular interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. Sunorc has a longer lifespan and emits less UV radiation, which increases the likelihood of habitable planets in its system.
        #LOC_KS_Tot_description = An asteroid moon orbiting around Suluco.
        #LOC_KS_Uleg_description = Uleg is a frigid planet with an orbit that takes it far from Kcalbeloh. Its surface is predominantly covered in ice. Its highly inclined and eccentric orbit suggests that it was likely captured by Kcalbeloh.

        #LOC_KS_RB_Enots = This one's strange... It's small like an asteroid, but it's shape is like some kind of eccentric artpiece.
        #LOC_KS_RB_Efil = It almost looks like Kerbin! This would definitely be the place to be! If we could get there that is.
        #LOC_KS_RB_Eulb = This one is big like the Mun... But is blue like Minmus? Ice cream awaits!
        #LOC_KS_RB_Elad = Whoa, this ones like the Mun but almost as big as Kerbin! Jeb always liked a good challenge!

        // Kcalbeloh
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow1 = Approaching Kcalbeloh at low orbit feels like being pulled into a bottomless pit, with the intense gravitational pull making it difficult to keep our bearings and maintain control of the spacecraft.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow2 = Lander 1, prepare to detach, on my mark.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = The intense gravitational forces made our instruments go haywire, and we had to quickly retreat to a safer distance.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = Temperature readings in the vicinity of Kcalbeloh are extremely high, indicating intense radiation from its accretion disk.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = The crew member reported feeling weightless and awe-struck while performing the EVA near Kcalbeloh. The intense gravitational pull was palpable even from a safe distance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = The crew report during an EVA near Kcalbeloh reveals a breathtaking view of the supermassive black hole's yellow accretion disk.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = A Mystery Goo experiment is not possible here, as the intense gravitational forces would likely disrupt any attempts to conduct an experiment in close proximity.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_KcalbelohInSpaceLow = The results of the gravity scan indicate a significant gravitational distortion, which could potentially aid future gravitational slingshot maneuvers around this massive celestial body.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_KcalbelohInSpaceHigh = The gravity scan of Kcalbeloh from a far away distance indicats the presence of large mass concentrations in the vicinity of the black hole.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = The intense radiation from particles in the accretion disk shorted the instrument before we could take a reading.

        // Onrefni
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = It is truly disconcerting to think that the light illuminating your view of this… unfortunate little planet is not from a star, but from material and gas sped up so fast by the looming Kcalbeloh’s gargantuan gravity well that it glows red-hot.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The planet itself seems to groan under the pressure of being so close to the monstrous Kcalbeloh, constantly shifting and cracking under your ship like cheap pie crust.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded3 = This place is about as structurally sound as Untitled Space Craft (before the addition of moar struts).
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = Mission parameters did not account for the temperature measuring unit to be exposed to this extreme of conditions. However, it does its job anyway, and kindly informs you that it’s… *balmy.*
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = It should NOT be this hot without a star nearby. Mass does scary things, usually at Onrefni’s expense.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = You liken the experience of walking on Onrefni as walking on large flakes of breakfast cereal, as you “hear” the crack of the surface reverberate up through your leg with each bounding step.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = Your feet are… substantially hotter than your head, as your currently panicking EVA suit operating system kindly informs you.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded3 = You find it difficult to move along the uneven, stretched-out looking surface, as the top layer of rock flakes off with each heavy bound created by your inherently clumsy attempts to move in 32% of Kerbin’s gravity.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The Goo seems to shiver in the far reaches of its capsule at the realization it is on a planet so close to Kcalbeloh.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The Goo appears to separate into different layers, as if imitating the inner geology of the shattered dwarf planet it rests on.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The samples you carefully collect appear greatly flattened and warped compared to “conventional” extraplanetary samples seen on previous missions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The rocks you collect are warm even through your suit gloves, and you feel a pang of sympathy for the, admittedly, inanimate yet tortured objects.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Onrefni_SrfLanded3 = You notice a fine particle dusting on the samples you collect that seems to coat everything on Onrefni, and you assume said dust is created and deposited by the nearby accretion disk of Kcalbeloh and the slow yet active breakup of the dwarf planet itself simultaneously.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The metal samples quickly puddle under the alien light of Kcalbeloh, and the volatile samples such as the ice begin to sublimate in short order upon being exposed to the harsh vacuum around Onrefni.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The pervasive, electrically charged dust that cakes the surface of Onrefni quickly begins to coat the interior of the materials bay. Much to your annoyance, the volatile dust causes the bay’s electronics to short, decommissioning your expensive new science experiment just moments after it collected some useful data.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded = The seismic instrument is utterly deluged in data stemming from both extreme tidal forces and near-constant impacts from the material in the nearby accretion disk, which characterizes the chaotic nature of Onrefni to a great degree.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The gravity readings fluctuate ever so slightly depending on where on Onrefni the readings are taken, likely due to the small world’s unstable terrain and wrecked interior geology.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The gravity on Onrefni, while certainly unstable, usually settles around a level that is comparable, yet slightly higher than Duna’s surface gravity. This fact backs up the theory hinted at by prior scientific readings as to the small world possessing a heavy iron core, as such a small body usually does not possess such high gravity.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = This isn’t what we meant by thorough exploration. The implication was that you were coming home - Ok. It’s too late now.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = You recall not being paid enough for this as you watch your vessel turn into metallic fondue.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = This is a crime against thermometers, and you know it. Sadly, it is too late to rectify your actions, as the thermometer has melted and is no longer with us.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = Why bother? You knew the answer. T O O   H O T .
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = You know, it was inevitable that someone denser than Kcalbeloh such as yourself slipped through the rigorous KSP kerbonaut selection process just to walk into lava on an alien dwarf planet. Enjoy your final seconds of existence, o… brave one!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = Thank you for your meaningful contribution to science and for your sacrifice just to discover that, get this: LAVA IS HOT!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = The Goo deserved better, but at least it perished in the line of duty to Kerbalkind.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = The Goo survives the unbelievable heat for longer than one would anticipate, but even it succumbs to Onrefni’s fury quickly.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = It melted. Absolute shocker, that.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = KSC advises you to not be so reckless with expensive hardware in the future simply to verify if the lava was, in fact, hot.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed = The gravity sensor spits out nonsensical series of data as it begins to melt under the punishing heat of Onrefni’s infernos.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = You have a slight hesitation at the concept of landing on the shattered world below you.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = You REALLY don’t want to land down there. The surface looks about as friendly as a rabid Kolar Bear.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = The thermometer does not yet suspect the wrath that lies below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = You’re not even on the surface yet and your temperature measuring units are already protesting, picket signs and all.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = You do not enjoy floating just above literal rivers of lava. The sensation is akin to standing just next to a hot water heater, even through your suit.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = Between the heat of the torn planet and the heat of Kcalbeloh on the opposing side, you feel akin to a microwaved meal while on EVA, and your coolant systems quickly demand a raise.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = If you didn’t know better, you’d say that the inanimate Goo seemed to be actively shrinking away from the small, broken world below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = The Goo erratically ricochets off of its containment canister, seeming to try to find a means of escape from it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = The electronic suite in the materials bay reacts in a peculiar manner to the uniquely extreme environment around this small world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = You observe the magnetic testing equipment lighting up like a Christmas tree within the materials bay whenever the black hole is in view of the instrumentation. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = The sensor struggles to quantify the game of planetary tug-of-war being played around it by the black hole and Onrefni.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = The boom quickly makes the theory that Onrefni possesses a heavy, proportionally immense metallic core credible, as it picks up the dwarf planet's somewhat strong (for its size) magnetic signature.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = You didn’t know a space rock could look evil… until today, that is.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = How did this plucky little ball even come to form so close around Big Boy over there?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = The black hole’s enormous heat readings still smother the estimated temperature data of the cracked rock beneath you at this distance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = You’ll need to get closer to Onrefni to get away from Nosey the Black Hole’s vast heat signature and get any meaningful data beyond “probably H O T (and bright).”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = You do your best “insignificant speck” impression. Hey, great job!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = You try to decide whether Onrefni is really small, or if Kcalbeloh is just really, really big. Maybe both? Further study is required.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = The Goo seems to be inert, as if paralyzed with the size of the nearby black hole in comparison to the comparatively miniscule Onrefni.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = The Goo stretches to opposite sides of its container, as if emulating the tidal forces that have shattered the little world below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = Before embarking on this mission, you didn’t think material samples could show fear, being inanimate objects and all. You were wrong. Those samples look utterly terrified in the presence of the cosmic horror that is Kcalbeloh, while also hurtling towards the troubled rock below at unimaginable speed.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = Some of the magnetically sensitive samples seem to slightly gravitate between both the black hole and the dwarf planet far below, which indicates that Onrefni possesses a large iron core, not dissimilar to Moho.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = At this distance, any substantial gravity readings from the small planet that would have otherwise been obvious are drowned out by the suffocating signature of Kcalbeloh.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = Even at this distance, a surprisingly ample magnetic signature radiates from Onrefni. The magnetic field's shape is perturbed by the overpowering field of Kcalbeloh, but there's SOMETHING there. You'll need to get closer to verify these readings.

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfLanded_Midlands = The lights from within your crew cabin illuminate just far enough to see the sandy bottom of the ocean where your craft has settled after sinking so far.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfLanded_Highlands = Against the crushing blackness of the ocean depths, you can see outcroppings of rock and - if your eyes are to be believed - underwater mountains. Maybe these are what drives the monsterous waves on the surface.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfLanded_Cracks = Your ship, now settled at the very lowest depths of the ocean, groans under the strain of the entire ocean pressing down on it. This is deeper than you imagined the ocean went...

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Lowlands = As you peer out of the crew cabin, you see the saltwater of Rouqea was over the view port, partially obscuring the horison. That's funny, the horison doesn't look as flat as it should be on an ocean planet...
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Midlands = From your crew cabin, the waters look calm around you. You close your eyes and relax, listening to the sound of the waves lapping against the hull of your craft. 
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Highlands = The crew module gives a fantastic view over Rouqea's calm oceans, standing up at your seat lets you see all the way to the mountains on the horison. Wait...
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Cracks = Floating over the deepest parts of Rouqea's planetary ocean, you note how choppy the waves are becoming and in the distance, how tall they crest! Some of them reaching up nearly to the clouds!
                //Low Flying
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Lowlands = From your crew module, you can see the clouds around and above you, and the calm sea below you. It's hard not to be a little unnerved by how close you are to Kcalbeloh, though.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Midlands = Your cockpit gives a wonderful view of the ocean, which stretches all around you. In the distance, you catch a glimps of a wave hundreds of meters tall as it slinks off over the horison.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Highlands = Rolling the craft, the view port catches a wonderful display; the clouds bowing out of the way, making room for a wave of titanic magnitude. With these waves, you almost think you might be flying too low...
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Cracks = Around the areas of Rouqea known to be the deepest, you see columns of bubbles rise from deep underneath the planetary ocean, only to be swept away by waves the size of mountains.

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Lowlands = Its hard not to appreciate the sight you see now - the accretion disk of Kcalbeloh lighting the azure seas and skies of Rouqea.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Midlands = Your craft flies gracefully through the air above the clouds, allowing you to catch every glint of the waves far below.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Highlands = Even so high up, its hard not to notice the mountainous terrain below you. It's hard to ignore the snow lining the pea- did that mountain just move?
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Cracks = Rouqea far below you, it's unnerving to know that the black hole that looms above is so close.

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_InSpaceLow_Midlands = It's hard to comprehens just how much water is on an ocean planet, and yet below you is Rouqea, looming in your view port like a gem of pure Sapphire.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_InSpaceLow_Highlands = Rouqea fills your window just as much as Kcalbeloh - a toast to both the Black Hole's scale and your proximity to the giant ocean world.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_InSpaceLow_Cracks = In the calmer portions of the ocean, you can almost see a reflection of Kcalbeloh! A distorted, broken reflection, but a reflection regardless.
                //In High Space
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_InSpaceHigh_Lowlands = Looks like someone flooded kerbin. Wait, that's not kerbin?

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Rouqea_SrfLanded_Midlands = For being surrounded by water, you watch the display read out higher and higher degrees of temperature. Something is heating up the sensors! R&D will have a field day with this.

        // Uleg
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Uleg_SrfLanded = Upon landing on Uleg, the crew reported extremely low temperatures and constant icy winds. They also noted the presence of large ice formations and evidence of active cryovolcanism. The crew concluded that Uleg would be a challenging environment for any potential future exploration missions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Uleg_FlyingLow = We were able to observe the planet's icy terrain in more detail during our flyover of Uleg's lower atmosphere. The surface was relatively flat with some small cracks and ridges visible. The frigid temperature and low atmospheric pressure make the planet inhospitable to life as we know it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Uleg_FlyingHigh = We flew through Uleg's upper atmosphere and encountered strong winds and intense cold. The planet's thick layer of ice and low atmospheric pressure made it difficult to maintain altitude, and our instruments showed that the air was very dry. The view from above was breathtaking, with swirling clouds of ice crystals and snow-covered mountains visible in the distance. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Uleg_InSpaceLow = As we flew in space near Uleg, we could see the planet's icy surface glistening in the distance. Despite being far from Kcalbeloh, the planet's gravity was still felt strongly by our ship, reminding us of the powerful forces at play in the universe. The darkness of space was only accentuated by the icy beauty of Uleg, making for a truly awe-inspiring sight.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = The crew reports that from high in space, Uleg appears as a desolate and barren world with a surface almost entirely covered in ice. The planet's highly inclined and eccentric orbit means that it spends most of its time far from Kcalbeloh, resulting in a dark and cold environment. Despite its harsh conditions, the crew notes that the planet's unique characteristics make it an intriguing subject for further study.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = The temperature on Uleg's surface is extremely cold, with readings consistently below freezing point. The ice covering the surface is likely a result of the planet's frigid temperatures, and it is unclear if there are any areas on the planet that are not covered in ice.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Uleg_FlyingLow = The temperature on Uleg decreases significantly as the altitude decreases, with a difference of up to 50 degrees Celsius between the upper and lower atmosphere. This is likely due to the planet's thin atmosphere and the lack of heat-trapping gases. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Uleg_FlyingHigh = The temperature in the upper atmosphere of Uleg is extremely low, which is likely due to the planet's distance from Kcalbeloh, as well as the lack of a substantial atmosphere to trap heat. The temperature scan also shows small variations in temperature across the upper atmosphere, likely due to differences in surface topography and ice cover.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_SrfLanded = As the crew stepped out onto the icy surface of Uleg, they were struck by the intense cold and the vast expanse of frozen terrain before them. The icy landscape was dotted with rocky outcroppings. The crew also reported a sense of awe at the stark beauty of Uleg's frozen landscape, underscoring the potential for scientific discovery in even the most extreme environments.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_FlyingLow = Due to the extremely low temperatures and icy terrain, conducting an EVA in the lower atmosphere of Uleg would be highly challenging and dangerous. It is not recommended to attempt an EVA in such conditions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_FlyingHigh = Due to the extreme cold and lack of atmosphere, it is not recommended for astronauts to perform an EVA in the upper atmosphere of Uleg. The conditions would be too harsh and pose a significant risk to the safety of the crew.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_InSpaceLow = As the crew member ventured outside the spacecraft, they were able to observe the frigid planet Uleg from the darkness of space. The planet's surface was mostly covered in a thick layer of ice, giving it a stark and desolate appearance. Despite the cold and harsh conditions, the crew member marveled at the beauty of the planet against the backdrop of the infinite cosmos.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = During the EVA in high space above Uleg, the crew member observed the frigid planet's ice-covered surface and highly inclined and eccentric orbit. The breathtaking and unforgettable view highlighted the planet's unique characteristics, captured against the darkness of space.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Uleg_SrfLanded = As the crew collected surface samples from Uleg, they noticed that the ice was extremely hard and showed evidence of having been exposed to extreme temperatures. The composition of the samples suggests that the ice is composed of a mix of water, methane, and carbon dioxide, which could provide valuable insights into the planet's history and formation.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Uleg_SrfLanded = During the materials study experiment conducted on the surface of Uleg, samples of the ice were analyzed for their chemical composition and physical properties. The analysis revealed that the ice on Uleg is primarily composed of water, with small amounts of other elements and compounds present. The physical properties of the ice indicate that it is very hard and brittle, likely due to the extreme cold temperatures on the planet.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = The barometer scan on Uleg's surface indicated a low atmospheric pressure, consistent with the planet's frigid temperatures and lack of significant atmosphere. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Uleg_FlyingLow = The barometer scan conducted in Uleg's lower atmosphere revealed a significantly lower air pressure. The readings indicate that the planet's atmosphere is extremely thin and unsuitable for respiration.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Uleg_FlyingHigh = The pressure would be too low for the instrument to detect any meaningful data. The thin atmosphere would not allow the barometer to function accurately.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = During the seismic scan on Uleg's surface, the equipment recorded several minor tremors, indicating that the planet may still be geologically active, even though its surface is mostly frozen. Further analysis of the data will be needed to determine the source of these tremors and their potential implications for the planet's geology.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = The crew conducted a gravity scan on the surface of Uleg. The results showed variations in the planet's gravitational field, indicating the presence of denser regions beneath the icy surface. Further analysis is needed to determine the nature and composition of these regions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Uleg_InSpaceLow = During the gravity scan experiment in low space above Uleg, the spacecraft was able to measure the planet's gravitational field. The readings showed a weaker gravitational force than expected, indicating that Uleg has a low density and may have a partially hollow interior.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = A gravity scan was conducted on planet Uleg from a spacecraft in high orbit. The scan revealed significant variations in the planet's gravitational field, indicating the presence of dense subsurface materials.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Uleg_InSpace = The data collected showed a weak magnetic field, likely due to the planet's lack of a substantial iron core. The results will be useful for understanding Uleg's geology and formation.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Uleg_SrfLanded = We collected gas samples and measured atmospheric pressure and composition. Preliminary results suggest that the atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and methane, with trace amounts of other gases.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_UlegFlyingLow = As the spacecraft descended into the lower atmosphere of Uleg, the atmosphere was found to be thin and composed mainly of nitrogen gas. Methane and carbon dioxide were detected in trace amounts. The analysis also showed that the atmospheric pressure increased with decreasing altitude.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_UlegFlyingHigh = The atmosphere analysis in the upper atmosphere of planet Uleg revealed a high concentration of nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide, suggesting that the planet may be experiencing some form of geological activity. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure was found to be extremely low, indicating that Uleg's upper atmosphere is very thin.
           

        // Maelg
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow1 = The body just outside the ship’s porthole seems not to glare and as a true star would, but mainly seems to gently bathe the hull and the surrounding bodies in a gentle glow.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow2 = From this close distance, the banding of the brown dwarf is clearly visible, further hinting towards its status of “not-quite-fusion.”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Maelg_InSpaceLow = While the thermometer kindly informs you that Maelg is indeed quite hot, it also reveals that it is only about a third as hot as Kerbol at its “surface.”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow1 = At this close distance to the brown dwarf with only your seemingly flimsy suit protecting you from its still-blazing temperatures, you question the Kerbal scientists that described the failed star to you and your crew as “small and dim” during the mission briefing.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow2 = The light emanating from Maelg is not as harsh as you would have expected, and is actually somewhat pleasant.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The unprotected Goo still quickly begins to cook and sublimate in the close-contact with Maelg, despite the brown dwarf’s technically low temperature (in stellar terms, that is).
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The lead samples and the other softer metals begin to bubble and float out of the materials bay in the heat-lamp like gleam of Maelg, while the hardier samples simply begin to glow with internal heat, not dissimilarly to the  stellar body just below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The indicated gravity at Maelg’s surface could be compared to a substantially more extreme version of Jool’s already powerful gravity well, as despite its (relatively speaking) small size, the failed star is able to hang onto Mehtna and Meiuqer quite securely, despite interference from the other nearby systems and Kcalbeloh itself.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The magnetometer reveals the fury that stews within the otherwise dim and feeble-looking Maelg, as it picks up on its violently strong magnetic field and the resulting radiation belts. KSC informs you to think of it as Jool's magnetic fields on steriods... times 50.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh1 = From this distance, Maelg almost has you fooled as to being a star. Almost is the key word here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh2 = All the way out here, Maelg seems to be but a dim night-light compared to the halogen floodlights of the stars you’re used to seeing. It is certainly not at all comparable to the unholy wrath of Kcalbeloh, or even Kerbol.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = From this distance, Maelg is not heavily detected by the temperature unit. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh1 = From here, Maelg reminds you of a lightbulb filament, gently glowing by itself in the infinite darkness. Compared to the cosmic horror evoked by Kcalbeloh, Maelg is quite comforting. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh2 = Even though the vacuum of space prevents you from physically doing so, you can’t help but feel warmed by Maelg’s gentle light. It is easily the most comfortable you’ve been on this trip so far.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to take up an amber tone similar to everything else in the Maelg system. Or is it just a trick of the dim light blanketing everything within eyeshot?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = The majority of the samples remain inert at this distance from the brown dwarf, with the notable exception of seemingly taking on the sepia tone of the failed star below. However, the magnetic testing bay within the materials lab indicates that Maelg has a very strange and powerful magnetic field and is likely quite volatile, despite its gentle appearance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = At this distance, Maelg’s gravity well is a bit faint compared to true stars like Kerbol, but is still palpable and far surpasses even the most massive of planets.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = From up here, the magnetic field detected is still quite tame, as is the rest of Maelg. The closer you get however, the stronger the violence within the brown dwarf will become relative to you and your diminutive ship.

        //Mehtna
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = You can’t help but be reminded of vintage photographs as you look out upon the seemingly sepia surface of Mehtna from the lander’s windows.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = Compared to some of the more extreme destinations on showcase in Kcalbeloh’s neighborhood, this is all a welcome change of pace.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded3 = You cannot help but feel comforted and even somewhat drowsy on this small, Duna-like sepia world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded_TempLow = On this side of the planet, the atmosphere partially condenses and falls to the ground in a sort of slush due to the extreme cold, not dissimilar to Duna’s poles, although in a much reduced fashion compared to that world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded_TempHigh = On this side of Mehtna, the thin atmosphere is heated substantially by the dim Maelg, and proves that no part of this barren, amber world is at all capable of supporting life, hot or cold side notwithstanding.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = You feel that everything around you resembles a faded, vintage photograph. Your own skin seems to take on an uncharacteristic amber tone.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = You get the peculiar sense while standing upon Mehtna that this world is truly dead, akin to a depleted battery.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded3 = It is doubtful that solar panels would do you much good in this dim setting.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = The Goo seems to both harden and take on a sepia tone, and also sublimates slightly in the tenuous atmosphere.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = The Goo no longer emanates warmth internally, and seems to become as lifeless as Mehtna itself. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = The samples you collect seem to not be totally structurally sound once moved, as if fragile from being static for so long.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = These samples will undoubtedly prove to be useful, as they are quite ancient judging from the seemingly unchanged environment that is the Mehtnian surface.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Mehtna_SrfLanded3 = The samples themselves appear to be a healthy mix of substrate and ancient chunks of ice.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = Depending on orientation of the bay itself, the volatile samples in the materials bay cycle between sublimation and freezing solid. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = The samples (with the notable exception of the water sample, which quickly boils off) remain mainly unchanged, besides seeming to react ever so slightly with the surrounding thin atmosphere.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The barometer confirms the tenuous nature of Mehtna’s atmosphere, although it also indicates that it is quite a bit thicker than Duna’s atmosphere. However, in comparison to planets like Roquea or even moons like Efil, this atmosphere is of little consequence.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The seismic scans indicate that the only detectable activity on this lonely planet is caused by the occasional impact.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The gravity on this world is quite substantial compared to some other destinations throughout the solar system and beyond, coming in at just over half of Kerbin’s gravity. You find it to be a happy medium ground to effectively explore this tomb of a world without being bogged down or flying off too far with each step.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The atmospheric analyzer indicates that the thin atmosphere of this planet consists mainly of carbon dioxide and water vapor, with a healthy amount of trace gasses. Mehtna would be a prime candidate for atmospheric resource harvesting!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_FlyingLow = You look out upon the strange planet below, noting that the geography appears to be totally alien. This is likely caused by the… unique solar situation Mehtna faces.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The atmosphere’s temperature constantly fluctuates depending on where the craft is above the surface.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_FlyingLow = This has to be against program safety guidelines. Luckily, the KSC is [REDACTED] light-years away, so they don’t have to know. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The exposed Goo flaps in the wind, but only ever so slightly. It sublimates as it does so, leaving a small trail of steam as the craft descends.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The farther you descend into the atmosphere of Mehtna, the less the volatile samples sublimate; however, they never cease to do so completely.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The pressure, even at this low altitude quite literally, is noticeably less at the top of the vessel than it is at the bottom of it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_FlyingLow = Precise gravity scans are not yet possible at this altitude due to the thin atmosphere being just substantial enough to unsettle the vessel and cause oscillations, throwing off the instrument. However, this in turn gives you some estimated wind speeds (and some ballpark gravity statistics, as intended)!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The atmospheric analyzer indicates that the thin atmosphere of this planet consists mainly of carbon dioxide and water vapor, with a healthy amount of trace gasses. Mehtna would be a prime candidate for atmospheric resource harvesting!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = You look out upon the strange planet far below, noting that the geography appears to be totally alien. This is likely caused- You have to stop looking however, as the force of atmospheric entry almost causes you to hit your head on the interior of your helmet if you keep turning to look out the window.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = The planet’s average temperature can only be roughly estimated at this altitude, due to how thin the atmosphere is. However, up here, it be cold. Shocker, we know.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = Are you TRYING to get torn off the ship’s ladder by wind shear and thrown into Kraken-knows-what at Mach 2?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = The Goo violently shudders with the rest of the vessel, while also seeming to fade in color to the same brownish tint as everything around it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = Many of the samples are shaken loose by the force of atmospheric entry, but otherwise do not yet react significantly to their surroundings. You do however note that the solar power experiment in the bay fails to collect anything but a trickle from Maelg’s faint light… before being shaken loose and thrown into the heavy metals section of the bay, heavily damaging it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = At this altitude, the atmosphere is far too tenuous to do much but shake your vessel as you descend farther towards the strange, beige-tinted world below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = Despite the perturbations caused by the vessel’s entry into the Mehtnian atmosphere, the gravity on the surface is estimated to be roughly equivalent to .5 Gs or so. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = The atmospheric analyzer indicates that the thin atmosphere of this planet consists mainly of carbon dioxide and water vapor, with a healthy amount of trace gasses. Mehtna would be a prime candidate for atmospheric resource harvesting!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow1 = The world below you reminds you of a muddied pond, or perhaps a polished ball of wood.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow2 = You can’t help but find Mehtna as a bit of an ugly duckling compared to the likes of Suluco or Aroura, but it does have a sort of comforting charm to it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = While the world looks desolate and static from this altitude, the thermometric instruments imply that at least thermally speaking, Mehtna is quite varied.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow1 = The brown planet bathes you in its light, and you suddenly find yourself craving chocolate.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow2 = Upon seeing Mehtna up close, you have the sudden urge to throw a mudball at one of your crewmates upon returning to Kerbin.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The Goo decomposes and takes up the appearance and consistency of hot fudge, perhaps in response to the unique radiation environment produced by Maelg.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The samples seem to be indifferent to their surroundings, with a lack of activity in the bay (minus the water samples quietly sizzling away, but nobody asked about you, Water Samples). 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The gravity below is estimated to be about half of Kerbin’s gravity, maybe a tiny bit more.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The magnetic field detected could be equated to being somewhat similar to Duna's, only amplified. This is likely due to the two planets sharing a number of qualities, only with Mehtna being substantially larger.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh1 = You attempt to clean the small brown stain off of the ship’s window… Oh. Wait a second. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh2 = If this small solar (or technically, brown dwarf?) system was a wine, you would describe it as, “Brown, with overtones of beige and a hint of sepia, perhaps just a mere touch of orange zest.”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The thermometer’s readings emphasize the relative weakness of Maelg’s heating compared to a star.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh1 = You think there’s a small brown bug in your helmet and you begin to panic, until your crew kindly reminds you of where you are.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh2 = The faint light of Maelg refracts through the muddy-looking atmosphere of Mehtna in a strange manner, as it makes said atmosphere look both thick and thin at the same time. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to drift towards the planet and Maelg as much as it can given its confined nature, seemingly in an attempt to feel warmth.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = Most of the samples appear to be normal, but a few of the more fragile experiments appear to have frozen in the low-heat setting this far from Maelg. You can only imagine how cold Meiuqer must be.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The gravity below is estimated to be about half of Kerbin’s gravity, maybe a tiny bit more.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The magnetometer reports that while a bit weak, Mehtna does indeed possess a palpable magnetic field! The field is not strong enough to protect anything on the surface from the solar/interstellar radiation from Maelg and all the other nearby solar systems, however.

        //Meiuqer
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = This dusty, cold little space potato is still undeniably fascinating to you and your crew.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = From this distance, Maelg’s already faint light fades to near-insignificance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded3 = The surface of Meiuqer appears as if it’s been thawed and frozen repeatedly for some time, akin to ice cream left to melt and then later refrozen.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = While the temperature on this small, strange world does fluctuate quite often in its orbit, it is never “warm” by any stretch of the imagination.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = The thermometer tells you the obvious in this particular situation: C O L D ! 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = As you stand on the surface of Meiuqer, you are careful not to sneeze and reach escape velocity. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = You wield infinite cosmic power. You lightly threw a nearby rock, and it has begun orbiting Meiuqer. Gotta love low gravity.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded3 = Man, you thought Gilly was hard to navigate. At least Gilly isn’t seemingly dark all the time or tinted like vintage film. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = The Goo freezes solid and dings against its container, loosening it and causing it to float away in a solid mass at Meiuqer’s escape velocity.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = The Goo nearly floats around in its capsule as if still in microgravity, especially once it begins to both sublimate and freeze in Meiuqer’s hard vacuum environment.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = You have to be careful while gathering your samples not to float away from Meiuqer.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_SrfLanded_Day = The barometer scan in Suluco's day hemisphere confirms the presence of a low-pressure zone on the surface of the day hemisphere, where the air is heated by the star, rises, and decreases in density. This rising air moves towards the night hemisphere at high altitudes. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_SrfLanded_Twilight = A barometer scan conducted in Suluco's twilight zone reveals a unique atmospheric pressure pattern influenced by the stark temperature difference between the day and night hemispheres. The scan indicates that the twilight zone experiences persistent strong winds towards the day hemisphere, likely driven by the temperature contrast between the adjacent day and night hemispheres. The narrow ring of twilit eternity creates a dynamic and turbulent atmospheric region with varying pressures. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_SrfLanded_Night = The barometer measurements reveal a higher atmospheric pressure on the surface of the night hemisphere, because the air from the day hemisphere cools and descends when arriving at the night hemisphere, becoming denser, and creating a high-pressure area. The descended air then travels along the surface back towards the day hemisphere, closing the loop of the atmospheric circulation. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_FlyingLow = The barometer scan conducted in Suluco's lower atmosphere reveals a complex pressure distribution pattern. In the day hemisphere, where the air is heated by the star, the scan indicates a low-pressure zone, because of the rising air due to heating and decreased density.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh2 = To think that’s the “portal” back home… You certainly put a lot of faith into something to get you back to Mom and Pop Kerman that you or even the best Kerbal scientists can even begin to understand in its entirety.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh = Your thermometer does not appear to have picked up that anything is at all out of the ordinary, despite the space-time-breaking anomaly within spitting distance of the vessel.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh1 = While cosmically horrifying in similar fashion to Kcalbeloh, the small “hole” in space-time is undeniably peculiar, and somewhat beautiful from this perspective.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh2 = Upon looking into the wormhole (which might as well be the eye of Kraken Himself), you are grateful that EVA suits mandate that you wear a diaper. You know, just in case for times like this. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh = The Goo appears to shrink away from the wormhole, as if in fear of it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh = The magnetic samples violently react to being so close to the anomaly, breaking off from the material bay’s structure towards the wormhole.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh = The gravity sensor’s readings fluctuate wildly, as it appears to be unable to quantify or even process this truly bizarre gravity field.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh = As you enter the wormhole's small gravity well, the magnetometer begins to give out unsteady readings, as if confused... or as if detecting multiple "nearby magnetic fields" as designed at once. Strange.
