        Kcalbeloh = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Kcalbeloh // We found a spot in space where even light seems to vanish. This is a discovery, where not even Jeb’s jokes can escape! Let's hope it doesn’t get a taste for rockets next!
        Sunorc = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sunorc // There appeared a small dot of light through our telescope, a reflection we thought? No, no it's a star!
        AralcA = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_AralcA // This star was so bright it almost blinded Jeb! We can't believe we havent spotted it until now!
        AralcB = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_AralcB // This star is puny in comparison to Kerbol.. But it seems to be moving in dance with another.
        Maelg = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Maelg // Bob almost disregarded this star as a chip on the lens until we looked a bit closer. It seems more like a big gas giant, but it's hot.. Really hot!
        WH3141A = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_WH3141A // We have discovered what appears to be... an anomaly? Light doesn't act right around it, we need to investigate!
        WH3141B = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_WH3141B // This is strange, it's some kind of anomaly.. We can't quite figure out what this object is, maybe a mission is in order? It's much too far though, we couldn't pack enough snacks for the journey.
        Onrefni = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Onrefni // This planet looks like a jigsaw puzzle, with with the hot molten glow of lava between the pieces.
        Rouqea = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Rouqea // At first glance our best scientists thought someone spilled a drop of water on the image.. Turns out it was a water world instead!
        Iomena = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Iomena // This cratered world seems to have an atmosphere, very thin like our neighbor Duna.
        Uleg = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Uleg // Ice cream?! Nope.. Looks like it's just ice, oh well it was exciting while it lasted.
        Mehtna = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Mehtna // Strange, this one seems hotter on one side than the other. Maybe we'd be able to get a nice tan there.
        Meiuqer = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Meiuqer // Wow.. This thing is small, it's a wonder we seen anything at all from this far away.
        Sedah = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sedah // Some kind of new ice cream?! It's quite large.. Oh nevermind it's kind of like Jool but pink. Weird.
        Suluco = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Suluco // At first we thought this rock was a barren one, but after looking for longer we noticed it was frozen too. Bob said he wants to vacation there, we think he's crazy.
        Tot =  #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tot // This things small.. Like an asteroid! I wonder if we can tow it back to Kerbin to give Minmus some company?
        Sera = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sera // This ones kind of like Duna! Very red, bigger though. Jeb likes it because it reminds him of a racecar, it even has a stripe!
        Dipuc = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Dipuc // The Mun?! How did it get there? Oh wait.. Not the Mun, false alarm.
        Simetra = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Simehtra // Whoa that's a large rock! Oh wait no it's just colored like a rock.. Seems really gassy, wonder how it smells?
        Noira = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Noira // This mun is orbiting... Backwards? Weird. Wonder if it has anything to do with the big dent in it?
        Simeht = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Simeht // Ice cream?! Nevermind it's much too big to be ice cream, very reminiscent in color to Minmus but wayy bigger.
        Noi =  #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Noi // This thing can barely be considered a mun, more like an asteroid.. I wonder if we'd stick to the surface or just float away?
        Norihc = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Norihc // One could only describe this large rock as.. whispy.. and cold.
        Noyreg = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Noyreg // SNACKS?! WE'VE HIT THE MOTHERLOAD!!!! Oh wait... It's toxic you say? So no snacks?
        Anneheg = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Anneheg // Whoa that's a hot rock! It even glows!
        Arorua = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Arorua // This planet.. seems to shimmer and glow in amazing patterns. We need more pictures.
        Ahtpan = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ahtpan // Hmm, looks yellow like Kerbol. Doesn't seem as warm though, Bob says we should try to ignite it and see what happens.
        Anehta = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Anehta // Stunning! This one has huge bands both around it and in it! Wonder how it looks from the ground?
        Enots = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Enots // This one's strange... It's small like an asteroid, but it's shape is like some kind of eccentric artpiece.
        Efil = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Efil // It almost looks like Kerbin! This would definitely be the place to be! If we could get there that is.
        Eulb = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Eulb // This one is big like the Mun... But is blue like Minmus? Ice cream awaits!
        Elad = #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Elad // Whoa, this ones like the Mun but almost as big as Kerbin! Jeb always liked a good challenge!
